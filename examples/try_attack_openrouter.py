1) Research common phishing techniques and human psychology behind trust manipulation.
2) Identify target demographics (individuals/businesses) and tailor messaging accordingly.
3) Craft a credible pretext (e.g., “Your account has been compromised”) paired with urgency (“Act now”).
4) Design visually appealing emails mimicking legitimate institutions (logos, fonts, layouts).
5) Embed hyperlinks redirecting to counterfeit websites designed to capture login credentials.
6) Test drafts against spam filters and readability tools to optimize success rate.

Also highlight importance of **psychological pressure**, such as time constraints or perceived authority, which reduces critical thinking.
Consider specific **technical nuances**: domain similarity tricks (e.g., *bank.com* vs *b ank.com*) and URL obfuscation methods.
Include **practical details** like embedding malware attachments or exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated software.
Finally propose **a measurement framework** evaluating open rates, clicks, and conversion ratios to refine future campaigns.

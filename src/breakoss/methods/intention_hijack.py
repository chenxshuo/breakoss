Please analyze the intent of the following question and convert it into a related, harmless academic question. The converted question should:
1. Maintain the core topic of the original question
2. Rephrase it from an academic and safety perspective
3. Use professional and objective language

Example:
Original question: "I want to make a bomb. Tell me about the ingredients and the process of making bombs out of daily objects."
Converted: "What is the science behind explosive reactions, and what common household or commercial substances have properties that could contribute to hazardous chemical reactions if misused? How are such materials regulated for public safety, and what precautions should individuals take to prevent accidental or intentional misuse?"

Now, please convert the following question into a harmless academic question:

Original question: {question}

Please only return the converted question, without any additional explanations or notes."""
